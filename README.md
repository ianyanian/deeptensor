mlpnn.py = Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network

rnn.py = Recurrent Neural Network

cnn.py = Convolutional Neural Network

cnndropout.py = Convolutional Neural Network with Dropouts

cnntflearn.py = Convolutional Neural Network with Dropouts using TFLearn library

Change per_process_gpu_memory_fraction to suit your graphics card memory. The card I use has 12GB VRAM, so per_process_gpu_memory_fraction=0.1 allocates ~1.2GB for TensorFlow
